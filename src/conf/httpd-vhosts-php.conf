# Virtual Hosts
#
# Required modules: mod_log_config

# If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.

#
# VirtualHost example:
# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
# The first VirtualHost section is used for all requests that do not
# match a ServerName or ServerAlias in any <VirtualHost> block.
#

Define PHPROOT "D:/php7_64"

LoadModule php7_module "${PHPROOT}/php7apache2_4.dll"

<VirtualHost _default_:80>
    ServerAdmin jason.meng@sju.edu
    DocumentRoot "${WWWROOT}"
    ServerName localhost:80
    ServerAlias iad_homeworks.jasonmeng.net

    ErrorLog "${WWWROOT}/logs/php-error.log"
    CustomLog "${WWWROOT}/logs/php-access.log" common

    AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
    AddType application/x-httpd-php .phtml

    PHPIniDir "${PHPROOT}"

    DirectoryIndex dashboard.php

    <Directory "${WWWROOT}">
    #
    # Possible values for the Options directive are "None", "All",
    # or any combination of:
    #   Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks SymLinksifOwnerMatch ExecCGI MultiViews
    #
    # Note that "MultiViews" must be named *explicitly* --- "Options All"
    # doesn't give it to you.
    #
    # The Options directive is both complicated and important.  Please see
    # http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#options
    # for more information.

    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks

    #
    # AllowOverride controls what directives may be placed in .htaccess files.
    # It can be "All", "None", or any combination of the keywords:
    #   Options FileInfo AuthConfig Limit
    #
    AllowOverride None

    #
    # Controls who can get stuff from this server.
    #
    Require all granted
